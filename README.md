# ios-webkit-keyboard-hackfix
Hackfix for iPad external keyboard's arrow & esc keys not working in web IDE's such as HackerRank.

Do not use for anything important, may break other things. Browser is very basic: URL and WebView, no popups or tabs.

Tested on iPad iOS 12.1.1 & iPhone iOS 11.4.1 with external Apple Magic Keyboard.
